**Problem 1:**

The code finds the top `k` most frequent elements from an array of integers using frequency counting and bucket sort.

**Approach:**

- **Step 1:** Count the frequency of each number using an unordered map.
- **Step 2:** Group numbers by frequency using a bucket sort.
- **Step 3:** Collect the top `k` frequent elements by iterating over the buckets from the highest frequency to lowest.

**Time Complexity:**

O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array.

**Space Complexity:**

O(n), as the code uses a frequency map and a bucket vector of size `n + 1`.

**Problem 2:**

The code finds the `k` closest elements to a given value `x` from a sorted array using binary search to minimize the difference between the selected elements and `x`.

**Approach:**

- **Step 1:** Perform a binary search on the array to find the starting index of the `k` closest elements. The binary search narrows down the potential subarray by comparing the difference between `x` and the middle element of the current window.
- **Step 2:** Based on the comparison, adjust the search window to the left or right half to find the subarray with the smallest difference.
- **Step 3:** Once the binary search concludes, return the subarray of length `k` starting at the determined position.

**Time Complexity:**

O(log(n - k) + k), where `n` is the size of the input array. The binary search takes O(log(n - k)) and extracting the `k` elements takes O(k).

**Space Complexity:**

O(k), as the result vector contains `k` elements.

**Problem 3:**

The code extracts the top `k` elements from a binary max-heap (represented as an array) without modifying the heap itself, by using a custom comparator and a priority queue.

**Approach:**

- **Step 1:** Initialize a max-heap using a priority queue where each element tracks its value and index in the original array.
- **Step 2:** Start by pushing the root of the binary heap (the first element of the array) into the priority queue.
- **Step 3:** Repeatedly extract the largest element from the priority queue and push its left and right children (if they exist) into the queue until `k` elements are collected.

**Time Complexity:**

O(k log k), because each time an element is extracted, up to two children are inserted into the priority queue, and heap operations take O(log k).

**Space Complexity:**

O(k), as the priority queue can hold up to `k` elements, and the result vector holds `k` elements.

**Problem 4:**

The code finds the length of the shortest subarray in the input array `nums` whose sum is at least `k`. If no such subarray exists, it returns `-1`.

**Approach:**

- **Step 1:** Compute the prefix sum array to efficiently calculate subarray sums. Each element in the prefix sum represents the sum of all elements from the start-up to that index.
- **Step 2:** Use a deque to maintain indices of the prefix sum in increasing order. This allows checking if the difference between the current prefix sum and the earliest valid prefix sum is greater than or equal to `k`.
- **Step 3:** Update the result with the length of the shortest subarray whenever a valid subarray sum is found. The deque ensures we only consider subarrays with increasing sums and removes unnecessary elements.

**Time Complexity:**

O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array. Each element is processed at most twice (once when adding and once when removing from the deque).

**Space Complexity:**

O(n), due to the storage required for the prefix sum array and the deque.

**Problem 5:**

The code finds the `k`-th smallest fraction formed by selecting two distinct elements from a sorted array of prime numbers, where the fraction is `arr[i] / arr[j]` (with `i < j`).

**Approach:**

- **Step 1:** Use binary search to narrow down the range for possible fractions between 0 and 1. The middle point of the current range (`mid`) is used to estimate how many fractions are smaller than or equal to `mid`.
- **Step 2:** Iterate through the sorted array, and for each element `arr[j]`, count how many fractions `arr[i] / arr[j]` (with `i < j`) are smaller than `mid`. Maintain the smallest fraction greater than `mid` to update the result.
- **Step 3:** Adjust the binary search range based on whether the count of fractions smaller than or equal to `mid` matches `k`. The search continues until the exact fraction is found.

**Time Complexity:**

O(n log(ε⁻¹)), where `n` is the size of the array and `ε` is the precision of the binary search. The binary search narrows down the range of possible fractions, and each iteration involves a linear scan of the array.

**Space Complexity:**

O(1) (excluding the input array), as only a constant amount of extra space is needed to store variables during the binary search.

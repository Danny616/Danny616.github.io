## Problem 1: Course Schedule II

The code determines a valid ordering of courses given a list of prerequisite pairs. It leverages topological sorting (Kahn's Algorithm) to determine if such an order exists, and if so, produce it.

### Approach:

- **Topological Sorting using BFS (Kahn's Algorithm):**
  - Represent the course prerequisites as a directed graph using an adjacency list.
  - Compute the in-degree of each node (course) to track how many prerequisites it has.
  - Initialize a queue and enqueue all courses with zero in-degree.
  - While the queue is not empty:
    - Dequeue a course and append it to the result list.
    - For each neighboring course, decrement its in-degree.
    - If a neighbor's in-degree reaches zero, enqueue it.
  - After processing all courses, if the result list contains all courses, return it; otherwise, return an empty list to indicate that no valid order exists.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(V + E)**:
  - \(V\) = Number of courses.
  - \(E\) = Number of prerequisite relations.
  - Building the adjacency list and in-degree array takes O(E).
  - The topological sort (BFS) also runs in O(V + E).

### Space Complexity:

- **O(V + E)**:
  - Storing the adjacency list, in-degree array, and the result list takes O(V) and O(E).

## Problem 2: Divide Two Integers

This solution divides two integers (`dividend` and `divisor`) without using the division or multiplication operators, handling edge cases like overflow and negative results.

### Approach:

- **Bitwise Manipulation and Doubling:**
  - Handle overflow: If `dividend == INT_MIN` and `divisor == -1`, return `INT_MAX`.
  - Determine the result sign by comparing the signs of the inputs.
  - Convert both dividend and divisor to negative values to avoid overflow when dealing with `INT_MIN`.
  - Use a loop to repeatedly subtract multiples of the divisor (found by doubling via bit shifts) from the dividend.
  - Accumulate the counts until the dividend no longer accommodates another multiple.
  - Apply the sign to the final result.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(log n)**:
  - Doubling the divisor and subtracting it from the dividend approximates a binary search approach.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(1)**:
  - Only a few variables are used regardless of input size.

## Problem 3: Coin Change

The algorithm computes the fewest number of coins required to form a given amount using a specified set of coin denominations. If itâ€™s not possible, it returns -1.

### Approach:

- **Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up):**
  - Let `dp[i]` represent the minimum number of coins needed for amount `i`.
  - Initialize `dp` with a sentinel value (`amount + 1`) to denote impossible states, except `dp[0] = 0`.
  - For each coin, update `dp[i]` as the minimum of its current value and `dp[i - coin] + 1` if reachable.
  - If after processing all coins `dp[amount]` is still the sentinel value, return -1; else, return `dp[amount]`.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(N * A)**:
  - \(N\): Number of coin denominations.
  - \(A\): The target amount.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(A)**:
  - The `dp` array of size `A + 1` is used.

## Problem 4: Design Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram

This example outlines a simplified architectural framework of backend services for a social network. It includes interfaces and implementations for users, posts, feeds, messages, and privacy checks.

### Approach:

- **Modular Design via Interfaces:**
  - **User Service:** Handles user profiles, follow relationships, and user data retrieval/updates.
  - **Post Service:** Manages posts, including creation, replies, favorites, repost counts, and retrieval by user.
  - **Feed Service:** Aggregates posts from followed users to produce a personalized feed.
  - **Trending Service:** Provides trending hashtags.
  - **Message Service:** Manages direct messaging between users.
  - **Privacy Service:** Enforces who can view certain posts based on their privacy settings.

Real-world implementations would rely on distributed data stores, caching, load balancing, and possibly machine learning models for feed relevance and recommendations.

### Time Complexity:

- Operations vary. For example, naive feed generation may be O(N) where N is the number of followed users' posts. Real implementations would be optimized with indexes and caching.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(N)**:
  - Storage for users, posts, and messages grows with the number of entities.

## Problem 5: Design YouTube/Netflix

This scenario represents a simplified backend for a video streaming platform. It includes services for user management, video metadata handling, transcoding, video delivery, recommendations, and comments.

### Approach:

- **Service-Oriented Architecture:**
  - **User Service:** Manages user data, subscriptions, and watch history.
  - **Video Metadata Service:** Handles video titles, descriptions, tags, view counts, and search.
  - **Transcoding Service:** Transcodes videos into multiple qualities for various bandwidth conditions.
  - **Video Delivery Service:** Provides manifests (like DASH/HLS) for streaming clients.
  - **Recommendation Service:** Suggests recommended and trending videos, often using ML models and popularity metrics.
  - **Comment Service:** Allows users to add and retrieve comments on videos.

In a full-scale system, these services would be supported by distributed databases, CDNs, indexing, caching, and recommendation algorithms.

### Time Complexity:

- Typically, O(N) for naive operations like searching or listing comments. Production systems would rely on indexing and caching for efficiency.

### Space Complexity:

- **O(N)**:
  - Storing users, video metadata, transcoded variants, and comments grows with the number of entities.

**Problem 1:**

The code removes the minimal number of invalid parentheses to generate all possible valid strings from a given input string.

**Approach:**

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Use BFS to explore all possible strings by removing one parenthesis at a time.
- **Validation:** At each level, check if the current strings are valid using the `isValid` function.
- **Early Exit:** Stop further exploration when valid strings are found at the current level to ensure minimal removals.
- **Avoid Duplicates:** Use a `visited` set to prevent processing the same string multiple times.

**Time Complexity:**

- **O(2ⁿ):** In the worst case, all possible substrings are generated.

**Space Complexity:**

- **O(2ⁿ):** Due to the space needed for the queue and the `visited` set storing all possible substrings.

**Problem 2:**

The code finds the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes in a Binary Search Tree (BST).

**Approach:**

- **In-order Traversal:** Perform an in-order traversal to visit nodes in ascending order.
- **Track Previous Value:** Keep a variable `prev` to store the value of the previously visited node.
- **Update Minimum Difference:** At each node, calculate the difference between the current node's value and `prev`, updating `minDiff` if the difference is smaller.

**Time Complexity:**

- **O(n):** The in-order traversal visits each of the `n` nodes exactly once.

**Space Complexity:**

- **O(h):** Where `h` is the height of the BST, due to the recursion stack.

**Problem 3:**

The code calculates the shortest path length that visits all nodes in an undirected, connected graph.

**Approach:**

- **State Representation:** Use a bitmask to represent visited nodes. Each state is a pair of `(current_node, visited_mask)`.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Initialize BFS from all nodes simultaneously, enqueueing each with their respective visited mask.
- **Traversal:**
    - At each step, dequeue a state and check if all nodes have been visited.
    - For each neighbor, create a new state with the neighbor and updated visited mask.
    - Enqueue the new state if it hasn't been visited before.
- **Early Termination:** Return the number of steps when a state with all nodes visited is found.

**Time Complexity:**

- **O(2ⁿ × n²):** There are `O(n × 2ⁿ)` possible states, and each state can have up to `n` neighbors.

**Space Complexity:**

- **O(2ⁿ × n):** Due to the `visited` array and the queue storing up to `O(n × 2ⁿ)` states.

**Problem 4:**

The code computes the maximum path sum in a binary tree, where a path can start and end at any node.

**Approach:**

- **Recursive Function `maxGain`:** For each node, calculate the maximum gain from its left and right subtrees.
- **Ignore Negative Paths:** If a subtree path sum is negative, treat it as zero to avoid decreasing the overall path sum.
- **Update Global Maximum:** At each node, compute the sum of the node's value and the maximum gains from left and right subtrees. Update `maxSum` if this new path sum is greater.
- **Return Maximum Gain:** Return the node's value plus the maximum gain from its left or right subtree to be used in parent calculations.

**Time Complexity:**

- **O(n):** The algorithm visits each node exactly once.

**Space Complexity:**

- **O(h):** Where `h` is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.

**Problem 5:**

The code generates all numbers from `1` to `n` in lexicographical (dictionary) order.

**Approach:**

- **Iterative Lexicographical Generation:**
    - Initialize `curr` to `1`.
    - Loop `n` times to build the result list:
        - Add `curr` to the result.
        - **If** `curr × 10 ≤ n`:
            - Multiply `curr` by `10` to explore the next lexicographical level.
        - **Else**:
            - While `curr % 10 == 9` or `curr + 1 > n`, divide `curr` by `10` to backtrack.
            - Increment `curr` by `1` to move to the next lexicographical number.

**Time Complexity:**

- **O(n):** The algorithm processes each number from `1` to `n` exactly once.

**Space Complexity:**

- **O(1):** The result list stores all numbers and never changes.

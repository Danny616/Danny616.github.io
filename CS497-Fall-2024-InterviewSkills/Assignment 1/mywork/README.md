**Problem 1:** The solution uses a hash map (unordered_map) to store each number's index as we iterate through the array. This allows us to check for the required complement (i.e., target - current value) efficiently.
- Approach: We use an unordered map to keep track of the indices of the elements we have seen so far. For each element, we check if its complement (i.e., target - current element) exists in the map. If it does, we have found our solution.
- Time Complexity: The solution operates in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array, because each lookup and insertion operation in the unordered map is O(1) on average.

**Problem 2:** The solution uses a binary search approach with two helper functions to find the leftmost and rightmost indices of the target value in a sorted array.
- Approach: We employ two binary search functions: one to find the first occurrence of the target (left boundary) and another to find the last occurrence (right boundary) by adjusting search boundaries based on comparisons.
- Time Complexity: The solution runs in O(log n) time since each helper function performs a binary search on the array, making it efficient for large datasets.

**Problem 3:**  The solution finds the median of two sorted arrays using binary search, ensuring efficient partitioning of the arrays.
- Approach: Perform a binary search on the smaller array to find the correct partition such that the left and right partitions of the combined arrays are balanced. Calculate the median based on the partition values.
- Time Complexity: The solution operates in O(log(m + n)) time, where m and n are the sizes of the two arrays, due to the binary search on the smaller array.
